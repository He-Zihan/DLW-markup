Abstract：This study explores the impact of innovation and international trade exposure on markup rates in labor-intensive firms, utilizing data from Chinese A-share listed companies and their patents between 2003 and 2022. The findings reveal that labor-intensive firms are facing a “Markup Trap”, where high international trade exposure, coupled with pressures from international competition, leads to reduced markup rates. Innovation in these firms further amplifies the downward trend in markups, as it raises operational costs and promotes more aggressive pricing strategies to capture market share and expand supply chains. Notably, the effects are magnified as international trade exposure increases, with international market competition and broader customer and supplier networks placing greater demands on firm costs and pricing flexibility. This research offers valuable insights into how innovation reshapes the market power and cost dynamics of labor-intensive industries within the global marketplace, highlighting the complex trade-offs faced by firms seeking competitiveness in international trade-driven environments.
